finalists:
  - name: Barnhardt Manufacturing
    website: www.barnhardt.net
    company: Barnhardt Manufacturing Company
    effort: The Barnhardt Integrated Technology Solution
    summary:
      - "The Barnhardt Integrated Technology Solution consists of three pieces of
        software: Work Order Generator (WOGEN), Production Scheduler, and Work Order Completion 
        Mobile Application (WOCMA). WOGEN is process that runs on our application server that 
        monitors sales order entry, creates manufacturing work orders, and then assigns then to the 
        proper work centers with the correct due dates based on lead times. Production Scheduler is 
        web application that provides a graphical representation of the manufacturing floor, allows the 
        production supervisor/manager to assign/reassign work orders to different work centers, and 
        provides displays the current status of work orders in production. WOCMA is the production 
        data capture application used by production associates to capture manufacturing and quality 
        assurance data on iPads as well as produce barcode labels. Assignments in Production 
        Scheduler and WOGEN are displayed in WOCMA on the iPads. WOCMA is able to store 
        transactions locally and produce product labels while disconnected from the central servers.
         The impact of the system was far greater than expected. While we expected the collection of 
        the data and metrics to have a significant impact on decision making, it also streamlined 
        production processes and created excitement in manufacturing. The use of icons and the touch 
        interface allowed for easier training with non-english speaking associates. User adoption of the 
        devices was rapid with many more comfortable with using an iPad rather than a PC."

  - name: ecomdash
    website: www.ecomdash.com
    company: ecomdash
    effort: ecomdash
    summary:
      - The massive growth of ecommerce, estimated to approach $2 trillion in
        2015, has persuaded retailers to escalate ecommerce efforts. And the low barrier to entry has 
        attracted millions of small business people to try their hand at Living the American Dream by 
        starting an ecommerce business.
      - As merchants continue to add new sales channels, managing operations becomes increasingly 
        complex. Until recently, integrating data and operational processes across multiple channels 
        has only been affordable for the top one percent of retailers. Ecomdash has made it possible 
        for small and mid-sized merchants to compete, scale and grow in today's omnichannel 
        environment.
      - Ecomdash is a software-as-a-service, cloud-based technology that enables omnichannel 
        retailers to run their entire business from anywhere in a fraction of the time they spend today 
        with better accuracy and from one central dashboard. At its core, ecomdash is a comprehensive 
        inventory, sales order, purchasing, shipping, and product listing automation and management 
        tool. It seamlessly integrates with marketplaces (e.g. Amazon), ecommerce website platforms 
        (e.g. Magento, Bigcommerce), shipping companies (e.g. Stamps.com), warehouses, fulfillment 
        centers, and suppliers. Unlike competitor Channel Advisor who serves large retailers as a 
        marketing-driven hub to connect-the-dots with 3rd party niche providers for inventory, order 
        management or shipping, ecomdash has built the entire software as an all-in-one.

      - By streamlining the omnichannel supply chain and synchronizing data, 24% of ecomdash 
        customers added new sales channels into their business repertoire. And user data over a 12 
        month period shows that customers also increased sales revenue by an average of 23% each 
        quarter after implementing ecomdash. As ecommerce and omnichannel retailing continue to 
        evolve quickly, ecomdash plans to be the "best answer" for small and mid-sized merchant 
        needs as new gaps in the marketplace are incrementally revealed.
