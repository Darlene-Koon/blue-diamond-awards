finalists:
    - name: Bank of America
      website: www.bankofamerica.com
      company:  Bank of America
      effort: Sales Fulfillment Transformation
      summary: 
        - Bank of America automated their online account opening process (processing requests for 
          products submitted through online applications for various types of customers and deposit 
          accounts). The project was named the Sales Fulfillment Transformation (SFT) project. The 
          Bank used RedHat JBPM 5 to dramatically improve customer satisfaction (product fulfillment 
          reduced from 16 hours to 26 seconds) and efficiency (standard platform that is easily 
          maintained and supported). The new platform resulted in eliminating human error in 
          account creation while CSR workload and desktop procedures were greatly reduced and 
          simplified. Finally, the new platform mitigated potential regulatory compliance issues 
          that occur with manual intervention.
    - name: LPL 
      website:  www.lplfinancial.lpl.com
      company: LPL 
      effort: Enhanced Trading and Rebalancing
      summary: 
        - LPL's new cloud-based trading platform allows advisors to save
          valuable time when making portfolio changes. Advisors can perform a range of trading and 
          rebalancing activities for any number of securities, client portfolios and accounts. The 
          Enhanced Trading platform features block trading capabilities that calculate average prices, 
          allocations and trailing stop orders to help protect market gains while managing downside 
          risk. This technology offers advisors significant time savings, allowing them to react to 
          market conditions faster and focus on what really matters-their clients. LPL Financial 
          Managing Director and Chief Information Officer Victor Fetter noted, Introducing the 
          Enhanced Trading and Rebalancing platform has been one of LPL Financials top priorities, 
          and is representative of the strides we have made in advancing the company's overall 
          technology strategy. We are directly addressing what our advisors have told us they need 
          and want.
    - name:  Rubbermaid Healthcare
      website: www.rubbermaidhealthcare.com
      company: Rubbermaid 
      effort: CareLink Mobile Nurse Station
      summary: 
        - As the leader in “point-of-care” workstations with over 100,000 units 
          deployed over 10 years, Rubbermaid Healthcare had to design its 4th generation mobile 
          nurse station cart. Carts are used in hospitals as nurses’ workstations when documenting 
          electronic medical records, transporting supplies and medications, and for telemedicine 
          solutions. They must accommodate a wide range of computers, displays, and peripheral 
          devices such as scanners, printers, and vital signs monitoring. These workstations are used 
          by nursing and other clinicians in patient care throughout most acute care units, including 
          general medical/surgical, critical care, surgery, and ER. These carts are one of the most 
          heavily used (24/7) and have “more miles” on them than any other clinical equipment in a
          hospital.
        - Prior generations of workstations, and competitors’ carts, utilized “dumb” electronics-based
          technology with limited features, plastic membrane buttons/keypads and possibly a small 
          LED display. An analogy would be the difference between today’s upgradeable smart 
          phones versus old cell phones that only had the features that came pre-installed. The carts 
          were inflexible lacking ability to add features, make changes, and were reliant on client 
          software installed on the hospital’s computer in the cart to supply any “smart” capabilities, 
          such as battery monitoring or PIN codes. Where offered, remote management required 
          installing server software. Electronics-based and client-server software architectures 
          became unwieldy to install and maintain, and were too inflexible.
        - To respond to these challenges, Rubbermaid Healthcare developed the CareLink Mobile
          Nurse Station, the first smart connected nursing cart in the market. CareLink connects with 
          N-Sight, a cloud-based system to remotely monitor and manage the fleet of carts. 
          Rubbermaid Healthcare applied for a patent for the overall design, which is an early, large 
          scale, successful example of an “Internet of Things” solution in healthcare.
