finalists:
  - name: Apparo
    website: www.apparo.org
    company: Apparo
    effort: Simplicity
    summary:
      - Apparo created a program 4 years ago to break the cycle of technology
        break/fix for area small nonprofits (less than 10 employees). Through that program funds were 
        raised to provide participating nonprofits with new laptops for employees, a networkable 
        printer, a NAS device and cloud-based infrastructure. This was the beginning of a Shared 
        Services model, named Simplicity, designed to help nonprofits transform their mission delivery 
        via mobile technology and processes.
      - The initial 3 years of the program were a learning curve for all involved, including the 
        technology being significantly changed by Microsoft to settle this past year in the Microsoft 
        Office 365 platform. This past year, Simplicity has truly hit its stride, serving 13 agencies - 3 of 
        whom are new in the past year. There is a subsidy for Managed Services; there is a 
        collaborative meeting twice a year; there is orientation for the Microsoft Office 365 as well as 
        implementation of the platform for new members; and there is 4 hours of onsite training and 
        support from Apparo team members over the course of the year.
      - We estimate that the three years of the program cost more than $400,000 and delivered more 
        than 500 hours of technology guidance and training, $102,000 in hardware, and true 
        transformation for the way these 13 agencies deliver their missions in our community. This past 
        year alone, has delivered an additional 100 hours of consulting support and $25,500 in direct 
        Managed Care subsidies to these 13 agencies. As one has said, "we would not have been able 
        to meet the rising demand for our services during the economic downturn without the 
        flexibility, training and strategic support or Apparo's Simplicity program."
      - Apparo is hoping that the winning of this award will highlight the impact potential of this 
        program to bring new players, both nonprofit beneficiaries and corporate sponsors, to the table 
        of a shared services model for technology support of smaller nonprofits in the region.

  - name: City of Charlotte
    website: Charmeck.org
    company: City of Charlotte
    effort: 
    summary:
      - As the City of Charlotte grows and experiences land use changes, leaders
        recognized the need for accurate address information to deliver services. Until the 
        implementation of a MDM solution for its address domain, the City lacked a centralized 
        repository for managing physical and mailing address information. While Mecklenburg County 
        functions as the physical address authority for both the City and County, the timing of address 
        data availability and level of address granularity created challenges for departments to provide 
        services. This deficiency led to duplicate or erroneous address records that created additional 
        challenges with service delivery.
      - Inaccurate address information was able to creep into databases whenever a name was 
        misspelled or a duplicate address was entered, to cite two common examples. To mitigate this 
        problem, the City embarked on an Address Management Program that included a business 
        process engineering study and the technical implementation of a master data management 
        (MDM) solution. The MDM approach was identified to focus on automated data quality 
        capabilities to cleanse address/location data & to provide a central repository. We needed a 
        master set of address records that could be used for location & mailing purposes. We also 
        wanted to obtain a complete understanding of all address processes, from the time that an 
        address is created throughout the history of its use.
      - The City purchased iWay Software to automate data profiling, cleansing, matching, merging, 
        enrichment, remediation, & monitoring activities. It enables the City to carefully check its data 
        records, identify duplicates, standardize discrepancies, remediate exceptions &create a master 
        database of "golden address records" with associated x & y coordinates (for geo-coding), USPS 
        address labels, tax data & tax fee data. The result is a consistent set of master records that can 
        feed multiple information systems, improve accuracy & give users a more complete view of 
        address data.

  - name: Charlotte Mecklenburg Schools
    website: CMSLearns.org
    company: Charlotte-Mecklenburg Schools
    effort: Digital Learning Transformation
    summary:
      - Advancing 21st Century Learning, Digital Learning Transformation Goal
        One of the Charlotte-Mecklenburg Schools' Strategic Plan 2018 is to, "Maximize academic 
        achievement in a personalized 21st-century learning environment for every child to graduate 
        college-and career-ready." The vision is to transform 165 schools serving over 140,000 students 
        into places of digital learning and teaching, where students have a personalized education 
        experience based on their interests, career goals and skills. We know that using a blended 
        model of teaching with technology tools, teachers can vastly increase the level of student 
        engagement. However, in 2012, CMS had no schools with infrastructure to support 
        personalized learning. Under Dr. Truesdale's leadership, a systematic plan for Digital Learning 
        Conversion has begun.
      - The goal is to jump start the transformation of 165 schools by a) providing technology-enabled 
        classrooms to access high quality learning experiences, b) developing a personalized plan of 
        learning for each child, c) supporting children so they move through school with peers, d) 
        imbedding professional learning for staff so they can lead this learning transformation and e) 
        varying learning time by extending the school day and augmenting summer learning, actually or 
        virtually. Tracking key measures to guarantee targeted outcomes is also an essential 
        foundation.
